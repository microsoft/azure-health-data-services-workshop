# Challenge-01 - Deploy FHIR Service and Azure Health Data Services Workspace

## Introduction

Welcome to Challenge-01!

In this challenge, you will deploy and use an **[Azure Health Data Services workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/workspace-overview)** containing a **[FHIR service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir/overview)** instance. In addition, you will set up **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)** as your API testing tool for reading and writing data to and from your FHIR service.

## Learning Objectives for Challenge-01

By the end of this challenge you will be able to

+ Explain the difference between workspaces and services in Azure Health Data Services.
+ Use a template to deploy a FHIR service inside an Azure Health Data Services workspace.
+ Create a service client application for Postman and grant it access to your FHIR service.
+ Configure and use Postman for sending web API requests to your FHIR service.

## Background

**FHIR service** is the core component for reading, writing, and querying structured health data in [Azure Health Data Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/healthcare-apis-overview) (AHDS). You may have also heard of Azure API for FHIR, which was Microsoft's first generally available product for FHIR. For this training, we will be focusing on the new AHDS FHIR service, which has some big advantages over its predecessor (like transaction bundles, AHDS workspace level configuration, and performance improvements for search, import, and export). Many of the exercises in these challenges will work with Azure API for FHIR, but some will not. In this workshop, to take advantage of the latest health data products from Microsoft, we will be using the AHDS FHIR service.

### Azure Health Data Services Workspace relationship with FHIR, DICOM, and MedTech Services

In the Azure health ecosystem, the Azure Health Data Services workspace is a logical container for associated healthcare service instances such as FHIR services, DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) services, and MedTech services. You can provision multiple data services in a single workspace - as in, you can have multiple FHIR, DICOM, and MedTech services in a single workspace to meet your solution needs.

The workspace also creates a compliance boundary (HIPAA, HITRUST) within which protected health information can travel. This means that configuration such as [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/healthcare-apis/configure-azure-rbac), private network data transit with [Private Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/healthcare-apis/healthcare-apis-configure-private-link), and [event messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/healthcare-apis/events/events-deploy-portal) can all be configured at the workspace level, reducing your configuration and management complexity.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to your Azure environment, please make sure that you have the following permissions.

+ **Azure Subscription:** You must have rights to deploy resources at the resource group scope in your Azure subscription (i.e. [Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) role).

+ **Azure Active Directory (AAD):** You must have [Application Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-administrator) rights for the AAD tenant attached to the Azure subscription.

You will also need to have [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) installed - either the desktop or web client.

## Step 1: Deploy AHDS workspace and FHIR service to your Azure environment

In the first part of this challenge, you will

+ Use a template to deploy resources with the Azure Portal. This template will deploy
  + [Azure Health Data Services workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/workspace-overview)
  + [FHIR service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir/overview)
  + [FHIR Loader](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-loader) (for Challenge-03)
  + [FHIR-Proxy](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-proxy) (for Challenge-07)

1. To begin, **CTRL+click** (Windows or Linux) or **CMD+click** (Mac) on the **Deploy to Azure** button below to open the deployment form in a new browser tab.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2Fazure-health-data-services-workshop%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fdeploy%2Fdeployfhirtrain.json)

> __Important:__ In order to successfully deploy resources with this ARM template, the user must have [Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) rights for the [Resource Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal) where the components are deployed. Before running the ARM template, it is recommended to create a new resource group first and check to make sure that you have Owner permissions for that resource group. Once you confirm that you have Owner rights, then choose that resource group in the dropdown menu when you fill out the deployment form (see #3 below).

2. Select or fill in the parameter values (see image below).

    + Enter a custom **Deployment Prefix**. This prefix will be prepended to the names of all created resources ("trn05" is shown as an example prefix).

    + Make sure to select the "true" values as shown.

3. Click **Review + create** when ready, and then click **Create** on the next page.

**Note:** This deployment typically takes 20 minutes. You can work on step 2 during the deployment.

Review [Step 1 in these instructions](../resources/docs/FHIR-Starter_ARM_template_README.md#step-1---initial-deployment) to learn more about the resources deployed with this ARM template.

## Step 2 - Set up Postman and test FHIR service

In the next part of this challenge, you will

+ Visit another page and follow the instructions on setting up Postman.
+ Make API calls to test FHIR service using Postman.

To begin, **CTRL+click** (Windows or Linux) or **CMD+click** (Mac) on the link below to open a Postman tutorial in a new browser tab.

[Postman Setup Tutorial](../resources/docs/Postman_FHIR_service_README.md)

Follow the instructions and return here when finished.

## What does success look like for Challenge-01?

+ Azure Health Data Services workspace and FHIR service deployed and available in Azure.
+ Other Azure resources for future challenges successfully deployed. Template deployment must have no errors.
+ App registration created in Azure Active Directory for use with Postman and your FHIR service.
+ Postman set up and able to connect with your FHIR service.
  + Capability Statement from your FHIR service - received.

    ```json
    {
        "resourceType": "CapabilityStatement",
        "url": "/metadata",
        "version": "1.0.0.0",
        "name": "Microsoft FHIR service 2.2.61 Capability Statement",

        "publisher": "Microsoft",
        "more below ..." : "..."
    }
    ```
